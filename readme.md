# About
MemorEmoji is a card game in which a deck of cards containing pairs of symbols are shuffled and laid face down on a surface. A player flips two cards over on each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. The player will have a limited number of turns to do this.

## Instructions
Enter the number of cards (must be even and in range (2,36]), and the number of tries (minimum number of cards / 2). Optionally enter the face values for the cards as comma seperated values (these must be in pairs and must equal the number of cards). The program will generate emojis as card faces if this field is left blank. Then press "game start" and enjoy!
